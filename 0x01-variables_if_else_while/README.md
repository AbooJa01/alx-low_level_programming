This project contains programs that:

0. Assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and  print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
**Requirements**
* The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
* The output of the program should be the number, followed by:
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative.

1. Assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
**Requirements**
* The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
* The output of the program should be the string "Last digit of", followed by n, followed by "the string is", followed by:
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0.
